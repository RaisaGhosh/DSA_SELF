https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/



Insert the elements of the first array into a map with key being the item and value being the number of times the item occur or the count.

Traverse through the second array and if an element from this array is already present in the map and has a count>0, then add it to the final answer and reduce the count of the element in the map by 1.

We are reducing the count value to make sure that if in the first "x" occurs only one but in the second array "x" occurs twice, we don't add "x" 2 times to the final answer because that is wrong!

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> intersect(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        
        vector<int> ans;
        
        unordered_map<int,int> s;
        
        for(auto it : nums1){
            if(s.find(it) != s.end())
                ++s[it];
            else
                s[it] = 1;
        }
        
        for(auto it : nums2){
            if(s.find(it) != s.end()){
                if(s[it] != 0){
                    ans.push_back(it);
                    --s[it];
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
        
    }
};
