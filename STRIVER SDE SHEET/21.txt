C++ :

PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS!

I used the below code but I don't really know what is happening, since the same code is giving TLE but then after multiple submits with TLE ,it is getting accepted.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        set<int> hashSet;
        
        int longestConsecutiveSequence = 0; 
        
        for(auto it : nums){
            hashSet.insert(it);
        }
        
        for(auto it : nums){
            
            if(!hashSet.count(it-1)){
                
                int count = 1;
                
                while(hashSet.count(it+count)) ++count;
                
                longestConsecutiveSequence = max(count,longestConsecutiveSequence);
                
            }
            
        }
        
        return longestConsecutiveSequence;
    }
};
```

I used the most optimal solution but it still gives:
Runtime: 2815 ms, faster than 5.00% of C++ online submissions for Longest Consecutive Sequence.
Memory Usage: 51.3 MB, less than 18.78% of C++ online submissions for Longest Consecutive Sequence.


JAVA:

```
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        
        Set<Integer> hashSet = new HashSet<Integer>();
        
        int longestConsecutiveSequence = 0;
        
        for(int it: nums){
            hashSet.add(it);
        }
        
        for(int it : nums){
            
            if( !hashSet.contains(it-1) ){
                int l = 1;
                int element = it+1;
                while(hashSet.contains(element)){
                    ++element;
                    ++l;
                }
                
                longestConsecutiveSequence = Math.max(longestConsecutiveSequence,l);
            }
            
        }
        
        return longestConsecutiveSequence;
        
    }
}
